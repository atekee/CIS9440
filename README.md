Project Description: New York City is well-known for many things around the world, none less so than its yellow taxis and no-nonsense, short-fuse attitudes. In line with these, our project examines yellow cab drivers, and their rides for passengers within New York, before and during the pandemic and how taxi ridership has evolved within that period. Particularly, we want to examine this from the perspective of passenger complaints to the NYC 311 Call center.

Data:
1) Our first data source for this project is TLC trip records provided by the City of New York website data page:
